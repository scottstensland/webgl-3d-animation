webgl-3d-animation
==================

An interactive 3D animation using WebGL to depict a 2D predator prey ecology on a grid real-time mapped onto the surface of a 3D torus.  Sound file is parsed then visualized both in time and frequency domains as well as rendered using Web Audio API - this is an exercise where I taught myself how to display data for an ongoing project on sound synthesis

Feel free to contact me on twitter if you have any questions! 

... my twitter name is same as my github name


   instructions on how to drive this ...

    run on a computer not on a phone since it currently uses
   just the mouse and keyboard as controls

     mouse left button and middle scroll wheel
           page up / page down
     arrow keys  left/right/up/down
           also these keys :  w s a d


      it uses WebGL for graphics
    I wrote it in the language javascript infact that was my
      "Hello World"  for both javascript and WebGL
