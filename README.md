webgl-3d-animation
==================

An interactive 3D animation using WebGL to depict a 2D predator prey ecology on a grid real-time mapped onto the surface of a 3D torus.  Sound file is parsed then visualized both in time and frequency domains as well as rendered using Web Audio API - this is an exercise where I taught myself how to display data for an ongoing project on sound synthesis

   instructions on how to drive this ...

    run on a computer not on a phone since it currently uses
   just the mouse and keyboard as controls

     mouse left button and middle scroll wheel
           page up / page down
     arrow keys  left/right/up/down
           also these keys :  w s a d


      it uses WebGL for graphics
    I wrote it in the language javascript infact this was my
      "Hello World"  for both javascript and WebGL
